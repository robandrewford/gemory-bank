*What is the primary task or area of development right now?*
e.g., Implementing user authentication and authorization for the Flask API.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions
*Summarize key code changes, design decisions, or architectural adjustments made recently.*
e.g.,
- Switched from JWT to session-based authentication for simplicity.
- Decided to use SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions.
- Refactored task creation logic to be more modular.

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate)
*What are the very next actions to be taken?*
e.g.,
- Write unit tests for the user registration endpoint.
- Define API routes for task CRUD operations.
- Update `techContext.md` with SQLAlchemy details.

## 4. Key Learnings & Insights
*Any new understanding or important discoveries during recent work?*
e.g.,
- Flask's Blueprint system is ideal for organizing API endpoints.
- Database schema design for tasks needs to account for future sub-tasks.

## 5. Open Questions / Decisions Pending
*What still needs to be decided or clarified?*
e.g.,
- How to handle password hashing securely? (Bcrypt vs. Argon2)
- What logging framework to use?

## 6. Blockers / Challenges
*Any current obstacles preventing progress?*
e.g.,
- Still debugging an issue with database connection pooling.
- Awaiting clarification on task priority levels from the Product Owner.
