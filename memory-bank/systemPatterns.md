# System Patterns: [Your Project Name]

## 1. Architecture Overview
*High-level view of system components and their interactions.*
e.g.,
- **Client:** (Not in scope for this phase, but conceptual: Web/Mobile App)
- **API Server:** Flask application, handles business logic and data access.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, stores all application data.
- **Authentication:** Session-based, managed by Flask-Login.

## 2. Key Design Patterns
*Which common design patterns are being applied?*
e.g.,
- **Repository Pattern:** For abstracting data access logic from business logic.
- **Service Layer:** For encapsulating business rules.
- **Blueprint Pattern (Flask):** For modularizing API endpoints.

## 3. Component Relationships
*How do different parts of the system interact?*
e.g.,
- `auth_blueprint` handles user registration/login and interacts with `UserService`.
- `task_blueprint` handles task operations and interacts with `TaskService`.
- Both services interact with their respective repositories (`UserRepository`, `TaskRepository`) which then interact with the database.

## 4. Data Flow
*Describe the typical path of data through the system for key operations.*
e.g.,
- **Create Task:** Client -> API (`POST /tasks`) -> `TaskController` -> `TaskService` -> `TaskRepository` -> Database.
- **Get Tasks:** Client -> API (`GET /tasks`) -> `TaskController` -> `TaskService` -> `TaskRepository` -> Database -> `TaskService` -> `TaskController` -> Client.

## 5. Error Handling Strategy
*How are errors caught, processed, and reported?*
e.g.,
- Centralized error handler in Flask for API exceptions.
- Custom exception classes for business logic errors.
- Standard HTTP status codes for API responses.

## 6. Security Considerations
*Key security measures and practices.*
e.g.,
- Input validation on all API endpoints.
- Password hashing using [chosen algorithm].
- Environment variables for sensitive configurations.
