# GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) Setup
**Your MCP server needs permission to interact with GitHub.**

Generate a PAT:

Go to your GitHub profile Settings.

Navigate to Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> Tokens (classic).

Click Generate new token.

Provide a descriptive Note (e.g., "Gemini MCP GitHub Integration").

Select the following scopes (permissions):

repo (full control of private repositories)

workflow (if you plan to interact with GitHub Actions workflows)

read:org (if dealing with organization-level projects/issues)

project (for managing Projects (V2) â€“ crucial for project boards)

Click Generate token and copy the displayed token immediately! You will not be able to see it again.

Run this in the terminal:
```sh
export GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_GENERATED_PAT_HERE"
```
